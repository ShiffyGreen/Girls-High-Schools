I am part of the vaad and I am compiling a list of girls high schools in Lakewood NJ. I would like to be able to keep track of them very easily.  
I am hoping that this list will be able to help the whole community with deciding about which school to send their daughters to. 

I would need the name of the school, the address, the phone number, the name of the principal, the number of students in each grade, and the number of girls in the whole school. 
In addition, I would like the amount the school charges for tuition and how much of a discount they usually give.  
I would also like to be able to see if the school is growing or shrinking 


Questions: 
Q: Are there any schools with the same name? 
A: No, there is a law in New jersey that you are not able to have two schools with the same name. 
in addition, there is a law that every school must call the 9th grade freshies, 10th sophies, 11th juniors, 12th seniors. 
I'm not sure why this is a law but that is how I need it in this system. 
 
Q: Are there any schools that are in the same building? 
A: Yes, there actually are two high schools in the same building. We don’t really recommend it but unfortunately this does take place. 

Q: Do you need to know how much tuition is coming in per grade? 
A: No, that does not give us a better picture of whether the school is financially viable or not. 

Q: Do all phone numbers start with 732? 
A: Yes they do 


Reports: 

1) List of how many schools are connected to an elementary school.  
2) Parents want to know the size of the schools, since they want their daughters to be noticed. 
   Show a list of each school’s number of students, from greatest to lowest. 
3) I want to know which schools are financially secure.  
   What is the total of the tuition money coming in per school? 
 

Sample data is in this order: Name of the school, address, phone number, principal name, each grade with the number of girls in it from 9th to 12th, tuition charged, discounted tuition, percentage of parents paying full tuition, connected to an elementary school, yearly budget
